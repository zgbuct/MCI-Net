# MCI-Net
Complex lighting impairs image quality, making it hard to balance resolution boost and detail retention. MCI-Net fuses Laplacian theory and high-frequency details to decompose and enhance low-light images with pixel-level Retinex. Also, Calibration-Net optimizes internal computations, trimming computational needs.
